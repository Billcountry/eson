JSON is great for sharing data in a human readable format but sometimes it lacks in object types support.
ESON does not re-invent the wheel, it just provides a base for you to implement extended JSON objects allowing you to
share data between services, apps and languages as objects.

ESON comes with built in extensions for date and datetime. You can write your own extensions to manage
custom data.

## Use Cases
- Sharing data between services over HTTP
- Saving data objects to databases or filesystems
- Sharing objects accross languages

## Advantages
- Increases the range of data types allowed by JSON
- Can be easily extended to meet your needs
- Available for multiple languages


## Languages
- **[Python](/python)**
- **[Javascript](/javascript)**
- **[PHP](/php)**
